# Steps to achieve in order to fullfill the project :


STEP 1 : done
 -> make a window and show it


STEP 2 :
 -> adapt the TestButton class to Swing
 -> you should keep Awt only to manage events


STEP 3 :
 -> add a drawing area in the Frame
 -> draw an example at (0,0) coords to ensure that the drawing is made in function of the drawing area and not the Frame
